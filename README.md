Powershell script to monitor and email report on StorSimple backups
===================================================================

            

StorSimple hybrid cloud storage device is managed from the [Azure Management Interface](https://manage.windowsazure.com). Local and cloud Snapshots are typically setup for its iSCSI volumes. The current Azure interface provides email alerts for various error conditions but it does not report on successfull backups. This script can be used as a scheduled
 job or task to run daily for example and email reports on StorSimple Backups.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
